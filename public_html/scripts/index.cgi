    <h1>FormMail Instructions</h1>
    <p><strong>Your installation is complete.</strong>

      <p>Note: 
        <ol>
          <li>FormMail has been installed here to send mail only from pages on this domain, <strong>countesswearvillagehall.co.uk</strong> to $recipient.</li>
          <li>For this basic configuration you do not have to make any changes to FormMail.cgi
          <li>For more advanced configuration possibilities see the  online FormMail
          <a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/readme/formmail.html">README</a> file.</li>
          <li>If you fill this form in correctly and click
                'Submit' a new file will be created called '/scripts/fm-contact-us.cgi'.  It is
                an executable CGI script that will display a contact form inviting the user to email a message to you. 
                Your actual email address will be hidden and is stored
                in a way that will make it hard for robotic email address mining robots to detect.<br />
                To use the form all you have to do is insert the following html into one of your web pages <br /><br />
                "&lt;a href=&quot;/scripts/fm-contact-us.cgi&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt;"<br /><br />
                This information is repeated in '/scripts/help/README-simple.html'.
        </li>

        </ol>

      </table>
    </form>

    <p>Try filling in the form above to send a test message if you like. You may need to change the email address in the settings first.<br /><br />
    You can make changes to this form or simply use it as a template by downloading this index.cgi from where you installed it and following through the comments.<br /><br />
    It will have to be a CGI file rather than an HTML file to include support for the image validation.
